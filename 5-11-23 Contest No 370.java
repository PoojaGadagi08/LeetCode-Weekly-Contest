1. Find Champion I

  There are n teams numbered from 0 to n - 1 in a tournament.

Given a 0-indexed 2D boolean matrix grid of size n * n. For all i, j that 0 <= i, j <= n - 1 and i != j team i is stronger than team j if grid[i][j] == 1, otherwise, team j is stronger than team i.

Team a will be the champion of the tournament if there is no team b that is stronger than team a.

Return the team that will be the champion of the tournament.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are two teams in this tournament.
grid[0][1] == 1 means that team 0 is stronger than team 1. So team 0 will be the champion.
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[0,0,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There are three teams in this tournament.
grid[1][0] == 1 means that team 1 is stronger than team 0.
grid[1][2] == 1 means that team 1 is stronger than team 2.
So team 1 will be the champion.
 

Constraints:

n == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
2 <= n <= 100
grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
For all i, j that i != j, grid[i][j] != grid[j][i].
The input is generated such that if team a is stronger than team b and team b is stronger than team c, then team a is stronger than team c.


  class Solution {
    public int findChampion(int[][] grid) {
         int n = grid.length;
       int max=0;
        int winner=0;
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            int cnt=0;
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
                if(grid[i][j]==1)
                    cnt++;
            }
            if(cnt>max){
                winner=i;
                max=cnt;
            }
        }
        return winner;
    }
}




2.Find Champion II

  There are n teams numbered from 0 to n - 1 in a tournament; each team is also a node in a DAG.

You are given the integer n and a 0-indexed 2D integer array edges of length m representing the DAG, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is a directed edge from team ui to team vi in the graph.

A directed edge from a to b in the graph means that team a is stronger than team b and team b is weaker than team a.

Team a will be the champion of the tournament if there is no team b that is stronger than team a.

Return the team that will be the champion of the tournament if there is a unique champion, otherwise, return -1.

Notes

A cycle is a series of nodes a1, a2, ..., an, an+1 such that node a1 is the same node as node an+1, the nodes a1, a2, ..., an are distinct, and there is a directed edge from the node ai to node ai+1 for every i in the range [1, n].
A DAG is a directed graph that does not have any cycle.
 

Example 1:



Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Team 1 is weaker than team 0. Team 2 is weaker than team 1. So the champion is team 0.
Example 2:



Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,2],[1,3],[1,2]]
Output: -1
Explanation: Team 2 is weaker than team 0 and team 1. Team 3 is weaker than team 1. But team 1 and team 0 are not weaker than any other teams. So the answer is -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100
m == edges.length
0 <= m <= n * (n - 1) / 2
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= edge[i][j] <= n - 1
edges[i][0] != edges[i][1]
The input is generated such that if team a is stronger than team b, team b is not stronger than team a.
The input is generated such that if team a is stronger than team b and team b is stronger than team c, then team a is stronger than team c.
