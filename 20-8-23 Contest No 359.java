1.Check if a String Is an Acronym of Words

  Given an array of strings words and a string s, determine if s is an acronym of words.

The string s is considered an acronym of words if it can be formed by concatenating the first character of each string in words in order. For example, "ab" can be formed from ["apple", "banana"], but it can't be formed from ["bear", "aardvark"].

Return true if s is an acronym of words, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["alice","bob","charlie"], s = "abc"
Output: true
Explanation: The first character in the words "alice", "bob", and "charlie" are 'a', 'b', and 'c', respectively. Hence, s = "abc" is the acronym. 
Example 2:

Input: words = ["an","apple"], s = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: The first character in the words "an" and "apple" are 'a' and 'a', respectively. 
The acronym formed by concatenating these characters is "aa". 
Hence, s = "a" is not the acronym.
Example 3:

Input: words = ["never","gonna","give","up","on","you"], s = "ngguoy"
Output: true
Explanation: By concatenating the first character of the words in the array, we get the string "ngguoy". 
Hence, s = "ngguoy" is the acronym.
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 10
1 <= s.length <= 100
words[i] and s consist of lowercase English letters.




  class Solution {
    public boolean isAcronym(List<String> words, String s) {
        String str ="";
        
       for(int i=0;i<words.size();i++){
           str+=words.get(i).charAt(0);
       }
        
        if(str.equals(s))
            return true;
        
        return false;
    }
}



2.Determine the Minimum Sum of a k-avoiding Array

  You are given two integers, n and k.

An array of distinct positive integers is called a k-avoiding array if there does not exist any pair of distinct elements that sum to k.

Return the minimum possible sum of a k-avoiding array of length n.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, k = 4
Output: 18
Explanation: Consider the k-avoiding array [1,2,4,5,6], which has a sum of 18.
It can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 18.
Example 2:

Input: n = 2, k = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: We can construct the array [1,2], which has a sum of 3.
It can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 3.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n, k <= 50


  class Solution {
    public int minimumSum(int n, int k) {
       Set<Integer> set=new HashSet<>();
        int sum=0;
        int i=1;
        
        while(set.size()<n){
            if(!set.contains(k-i)){
                set.add(i);
                sum+=i;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}


3.Maximize the Profit as the Salesman

  You are given an integer n representing the number of houses on a number line, numbered from 0 to n - 1.

Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array offers where offers[i] = [starti, endi, goldi], indicating that ith buyer wants to buy all the houses from starti to endi for goldi amount of gold.

As a salesman, your goal is to maximize your earnings by strategically selecting and selling houses to buyers.

Return the maximum amount of gold you can earn.

Note that different buyers can't buy the same house, and some houses may remain unsold.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, offers = [[0,0,1],[0,2,2],[1,3,2]]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 5 houses numbered from 0 to 4 and there are 3 purchase offers.
We sell houses in the range [0,0] to 1st buyer for 1 gold and houses in the range [1,3] to 3rd buyer for 2 golds.
It can be proven that 3 is the maximum amount of gold we can achieve.
Example 2:

Input: n = 5, offers = [[0,0,1],[0,2,10],[1,3,2]]
Output: 10
Explanation: There are 5 houses numbered from 0 to 4 and there are 3 purchase offers.
We sell houses in the range [0,2] to 2nd buyer for 10 golds.
It can be proven that 10 is the maximum amount of gold we can achieve.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
1 <= offers.length <= 105
offers[i].length == 3
0 <= starti <= endi <= n - 1
1 <= goldi <= 103
